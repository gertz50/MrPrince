								In today’s digital age, meeting new people online has become a normal part of our daily lives.<br> 
								Social media platforms, forums, and other online communities offer endless opportunities to connect<br>  
								with people who share our interests and values, regardless of where they live. However,<br>  
								meeting strangers on the internet is not without its risks, and caution is essential,<br>  
								especially when transitioning from an online interaction to an in-person meeting.<br><br> 

								The darker side of meeting strangers online is well-documented. From catfishing to scams,<br>  
								there are many risks involved in trusting someone you’ve only met virtually. Stories of fraud, harassment,<br>  
								or even dangerous situations arising from online encounters are enough to make anyone wary.<br>  
								In worst-case scenarios, meeting an internet stranger can lead to harm, with cases of stalking, violence,<br>  
								or exploitation highlighting the potential consequences.<br>  
								This is why many experts advise taking certain precautions, like meeting in public places,<br>  
								informing someone you trust, and doing a little research before agreeing to an in-person meeting.<br><br> 

								Despite these risks, not all internet encounters lead to trouble—many end up being the start of amazing,<br>  
								long-lasting friendships. In fact, one of my own experiences speaks to the positive side of meeting people online.<br>  
								Back in 2016, I reached out to a fellow Twitter user named Jason, or <a href="https://x.com/SonJasoon" target="_blank">@SonJasoon</a>,<br>  
								asking where I could watch the latest Dragon Ball Super livestream.<br>  
								That simple question turned into regular chats and an evolving online friendship.<br>  
								Finally, in October 2019, we decided to meet in person. To my surprise, we connected right away,<br>  
								like we had known each other forever, and a real bond began to grow.<br><br>

								<a href="pics/riddle1/dbs2016.jpg" target="_blank">
									<img style="max-height: 400px;" src="pics/riddle1/dbs2016.jpg"></img> 
								</a>
								<a href="pics/riddle1/jason2019.jpg" target="_blank">
									<img style="max-height: 400px;" src="pics/riddle1/jason2019.jpg"></img> 
								</a><br><br> 
								
								One fun tradition came out of that first meeting: every time we meet for the first time after a while,<br>  
								we bring a Kinder Maxi King and a purple Red Bull to share. Our paths split briefly after October 20, 2019,<br>  
								but we met again in June 2020, where we shot a hilarious video of Jason laughing uncontrollably,<br>
								almost like a kettle boiling over, completely out of breath.<br><br>

								<a href="pics/riddle1/byejason2019.jpg" target="_blank">
									<img style="max-height: 400px;" src="pics/riddle1/byejason2019.jpg"></img> 
								</a>
								<video height="400" controls>
									<source src="pics/riddle1/jasonlache.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video><br><br> 

								In January 2022, the tables turned. This time, instead of Jason visiting us,<br>  
								our whole friend group traveled to see him!<br>  
								The excitement was unreal—I couldn’t stop laughing the entire night,<br>  
								and poor Alperen was my target that night, even though he hadn’t said a word.<br>  
								It was a mix of reactions; some found it funny, and others were understandably a bit annoyed!<br>  
								We shared so many ridiculous moments on that trip, including one memorable night sharing a double bed.<br>  
								I barely made it through due to Jason’s intense snoring,<br>  
								ultimately giving up and finding a quieter place to sleep (shoutout to Simon for handling it like a champ).<br><br> 

								Looking back, that journey stands out as one of the most memorable experiences of my life,<br>  
								filled with laughter and moments of pure fun. The last time we met was this June, and although it was brief,<br>  
								it was my turn to bring the Red Bull and Maxi King. Once again, it was a joy to see him.<br><br>  

								Through Jason, I also had the privilege of meeting Simon <a href="https://x.com/HerrPopc0rn" target="_blank">(@HerrPopc0rn)</a>, undoubtedly one of the kindest, most genuine people<br>  
								I’ve ever known.<br><br>

								<a href="pics/riddle1/simon.jpg" target="_blank">

									<img style="max-height: 400px;" src="pics/riddle1/simonGroup.jpg"></img> 
								</a><br><br> 

								Ultimately, while caution is wise, my story is a reminder that not all internet strangers are dangerous.<br>  
								Sometimes, they become lifelong friends who bring unforgettable experiences, funny traditions,<br>  
								and meaningful bonds into our lives.<br><br>

								<i>
									This post is dedicated to the fact that yesterday (November 13, 2024),<br> 
									marked the 8th anniversary of the day we first connected over Twitter through Dragon Ball Super.

						<h1>Reclaiming the Internet: A Tribute to the Lost Web</h1>
						<p>Welcome to Mr-Prince.com, a digital sanctuary that stands in stark opposition to the rapid modernization of the internet.<br> 
							Our mission is simple: to resist the cookie-cutter designs and soulless mobile optimization that dominate today's web.<br> 
							We believe that the web has lost much of its character, personality, and charm. The internet we once knew,<br> 
							filled with unique designs and personal touches, is rapidly being replaced by sterile, standardized experiences.<br><br>

							Mobile views—optimized for small screens—are an abomination in our eyes.<br> 
							It's a trend that strips websites of their originality and individuality.<br> 
							At Mr-Prince.com, we reject this idea, holding on to the nostalgia of the early 2000s when the internet was a chaotic,<br> 
							yet beautifully personal place.<br><br>
							
							Our design is a tribute to the websites of the late 2000s, and in some ways, a rebellion against the modern internet.<br> 
							We intentionally embrace the aesthetic and quirks of that time, bringing back a sense of fun and<br> 
							freedom that has been lost to corporate-driven, mobile-first approaches.<br><br>
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>"The more we use the internet, the more we become afraid of people who are not like us, 
								and the more we build walls around ourselves."  
								<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier">
									-Jaron Lanier
								</a>
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							<br>According to the "Dead Internet Theory", which we believe is no longer just a theory but a sad truth,<br> 
							much of the internet has become automated, homogenized, and devoid of real human influence.<br> 
							Since 2019, this theory has become a reality, and we at Mr-Prince.com are here to push back,<br> 
							offering an alternative space where the internet still has personality, diversity, and life.<br> 
							This website serves as a counterpoint to the modern web, a digital space where nostalgia and rebellion meet.
